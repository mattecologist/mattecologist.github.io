 My career has been centred on applied ecology, entomology and invasion biology to support integrated pest management, biosecurity and market access. I draw from ecological knowledge, analytical skills, engagement capability and diverse collaborations to develop outputs that inform decision makers and policy. My goal is to always conduct research, coordinate projects and develop solutions that expand and apply scientific knowledge in order to aid both conservation of biodiversity and food security into the future.
