summary: > # Leave the greater-than sign on this line, it is necessary for proper formatting of the text below.
My career has been centred on applied ecology, entomology and invasion biology to support integrated pest management, biosecurity and market access.
This page provides a list of the different articles I have written or contributed to. Currently these all link back to the publisher websites, but I am also happy to send a copy.
