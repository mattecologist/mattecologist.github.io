	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The European earwig, ForÔ¨Åcula auricularia (L.) (Dermaptera: ForÔ¨Åculidae), is regarded as an important beneÔ¨Åcial in many orchard environments but has the potential to be a plant pest in other systems, including to grain crops. Due to its agricultural importance, the lifecycle of F. auricularia has been widely studied in North America and Europe. However, much less is known in the southern hemisphere, including Australia where F. auricularia has been present for over 170 years.
RESULTS: To elucidate the lifecycle of F. auricularia, we monitored Ô¨Åve sites in grain-growing areas of southern Australia using two different trap types. Adults were found year-round, but most prevalent from late-spring to mid-winter. First instars were typically found from mid to late winter. Second, third and fourth instars occurred from winter through to late spring. The seasonal development of F. auricularia in Australia may be much earlier than observed in comparable North American studies. Degree day modelling highlights variation in development times across the active season for F. auricularia across our sites.
CONCLUSION: ForÔ¨Åcula auricularia is well adapted to the Australian grain growing environments. The timing of egg hatching aligns closely with crop emergence, juveniles then develop alongside the crop, and adult development occurs by harvest time in late spring. These Ô¨Åndings are important given that many of these crops (canola, lucerne, pulses) are vulnerable to attack by F. auricularia during emergence and development. They also suggest a phenotypic capacity of this species to adapt different phenology after introduction into a novel environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: By modelling species‚Äìenvironment relationships of pest species, it is possible to understand potential limits to their distributions when they invade new regions, and their likely continued spread. The European earwig, ForÔ¨Åcula auricularia, is a non-native invasive species in Australia that has been in the country for over 170 years. However, in the last few decades it has invaded new areas. Unlike in other countries, F. auricularia is a pest species of grain production in Australia. In this study we detail the Australian distribution of this species, adding new samples focused around grain-growing regions. Using this information, we build global species distribution models for F. auricularia to better understand species‚Äìenvironment relationships.
RESULTS: Our models indicate that the distribution of F. auricularia is strongly associated with temperate through to semi-arid environments, a high winter rainfall and pronounced temperature seasonality. We identiÔ¨Åed regions that hold suitable, but as yet vacant, niche space for Australian populations, suggesting further potential for range expansion. Beyond climate, an index describing human inÔ¨Çuence on the landscape was important to understand the distribution limits of this pest. We identiÔ¨Åed regions where there was suitable climate space, but which F. auricularia has not occupied, probably due to low levels of human impact.
CONCLUSION: Modelling the global distribution of a non-native pest species aided understanding of the regional distribution limits within Australia and highlighted the usefulness of human impact measures for modelling globally invasive insect species. ¬© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Predicting novel ranges of non-native species is a critical component to understanding the biosecurity threat posed by pests and diseases on economic, environmental and social assets. Species distribution models (SDMs) are often employed to predict the potential ranges of exotic pests and diseases in novel environments and geographic space. To date, researchers have focused on model complexity, data available for model fitting, the size of the geographic area to be considered and how the choice of model impacts results. These investigations are coupled with considerable examination of how model evaluation methods and test scores are influenced by these choices. An area that remains under-discussed is how to account for uncertainty in predictor selection while also selecting variables that increase a model‚Äôs ability to predict to novel environments (model transferability). Here we propose a novel method to finesse this problem by using multiple simple (bivariate) models to search for the candidate sets of predictor variables that are likely to produce transferable models. Once identified, each set is then used to construct 2-dimehttps://www.overleaf.com/project/5d26cf1150cfdf6444b93c52nsional niche envelopes of pest presence/absence. This process ultimately results in a number of possible models that can be used to predict pest potential distributions, however, rather than relying on a single model, we ensemble these models in an attempt to account for predictor uncertainty. We apply this method to both virtual species and real species data, and find that it generally performs well against conventional approaches for statistically fitting numerous variables in a single model. While our methods only consider simple ecological relationships of species to environmental predictors, they allow for increased model transferability because they reduce the likelihood of over-fitting and collinearity issues. Simple models are also likely to be more conservative (over-predict potential distributions) relative to complex models containing many covariates ‚Äì making them more appropriate for risk-averse applications such as biosecurity. The approach we have explored transforms a model selection problem, for which there is no true correct answer amongst the typically distal covariates on offer, to one of model uncertainty. We argue that increased model transferability at the expense of model interpretation is perhaps more important for effective rapid predictions and management of non-native species and biological invasions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

These networks have diverse targets, goals, and efÔ¨Åciencies, but all are constrained by practical considerations like cost and available lures. An important way to balance goals and constrains is through quantitative mathematical modeling. Here we describe an extension of a computer model of trapping networks known as ‚ÄúTrapGrid‚Äù to include an alternative mode of calculating the probability of capture over time in a trapping network: Strict detection (‚Äúcapture of one or more‚Äù) compared with the average probability of capture as implemented in the original version. We suggest that this new calculation may be useful in situations of low prevalence where trap network operators wish to interpret the meaning of zero captures at a small scale. The original remains preferred for comparing the sensitivity and suitability of alternate trap networks (i.e. density of traps, their placement, lure attractiveness, etc).},
